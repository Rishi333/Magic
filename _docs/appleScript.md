What if a programming felt like writing English? This was a idea that failed in the early days of programming. In todayâ€™s world Apple Script made a brilliant attempt to make scripting enjoyable. Apple Script feels like commanding a computer through human writable English. My initial attraction to Apple Script came from its iChat plugin. IChat is a chat service that can connect to various other chat services. It is currently known as messages on the mac book. I realized that I could connect to Facebook using iChat and send messages. To trick my friend into staying up all night. I wrote a script that would respond every 15 minutes.

The script is more than just useful; it is beautiful to read. That is the greatest feature of Apple Script. Sadly, its use cases are very limited. I dream of a time, where all programming languages are as readable as AppleScript.
