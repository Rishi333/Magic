A community of developers ranges from optimistic programmer to tocix linux administration. The arch Linux community has decided to form its community with both elements in mind. The community has the core rule of “RTFD”- Read the Freakin Documentation. Although toxic, the rule keeps the Arch Linux community clean. You truly build your own computer with the Arch Linux distro. They start you with a minimalist machine and expect you to carve your way to enlightenment.

  The process took me over a hundred hours, but built me an unimaginable machine. Arch Linux is truly user centric and has the greatest package manager. Their package manager is named pacman and provides a bleeding edge experience. The package manager updates everyt package the the latest without any computer restart required. That’s a feature Mac and windows will never have. In terms of hosting on linux, I will sadly be leaving Arch Linux and use an easier deployment. However, given that one day I have to free time once again, I will build another dream computer with none other than gorgeous user-centric Arch Linux.
