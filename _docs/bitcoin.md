Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that can be securely exchanged across the internet. When I started working on a bitcoin miner, the bitcoin was valued at $200. I was in 12th grade and recently was enlightened to the world of Linux. I quickly realized that anyone with a base Linux system could be making $$$. However, I was ignorant at the amount of money I could make. I ended up making cents that successfully offset the electricity bill.
