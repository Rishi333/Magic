A developer has many development environments to choose. However, all development environments are only as great as their features. Emacs differs from this approach by being a extensible macro editor. Emacs can be the most powerful editor for the most specific use case. I have found doing a good portion of my development in Emacs to be efficient and enjoyable. A key addition to Emacs is MELPA, which is a package library for Emacs. I have written my own init.el that hot keys many simple things I do into one key. For example, Open ruby environment or open terminal. I also have added hundreds of packages to my MELPA library for maximum impact Emacs. Emacs has a hard initial learning curve, but with time becomes simple.
