Every Programmer’s dream is to finally create your own programming language. As a programmer, you must use hundreds of languages, but none of them ever feel like the right one. Writing an entire “language” which in technical terms is called writing a “compiler.”

The problem is that when you write a compiler, you realize that it is a difficult problem. The beauty of programming languages is in the user experience. I made my language simple for everyone to use. As the title says, I named it after its purpose- I can code. I even wrote a small digital novel game on top of the language. Anyone can play and see the source code for the programming language and the game.

I would like to thank Aishwarya Wenkateswaran and David for the help in building this beautiful compiler. I also give a shout out to all the open source code I used. Which includes, but is not limited to kava, Git, JJtree, Git, Javacc, Github, Pascal, Git.
