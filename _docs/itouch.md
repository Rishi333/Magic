Since a young age, I wanted to get a PDS. A PDA is a “Personal Digital Assistant.” A PDA is capable of managing your entire life digitally. It is a digital device the size of your hand. It has very unique applications such as clock, calendar, and weather.

In today’s world, the simplest smart phone can do everything a PDS can accomplish and much more. By the time my father agreed to get me a PDS, the PDS had become outdated and obsolete. However, it was replaced by the itouch. The itouch was a revolutionary device that instantly had a community built around it. The original iPod was a single purpose machine that had very few use cases. Similar to the PDA. However, once you jailbreak the device, the possibilities were endless. 
	
The device was Unix based, and had a generation of developers to aid its journey. I was still in 9th grade, but was enthralled to join the community as a user. My 32GB iPod touch 3rd generation was absolutely pimped out.  Not only did it have the ability to connect to hotspots with weaker security, but it also had the ability to run Xbox original games. I remember one of my greatest feat was making halo 1 run on my itouch and beating the game. 

In the end, I was completely fascinated at what was possible with a community. It made me realize that I could completely get lost with a community of software.
