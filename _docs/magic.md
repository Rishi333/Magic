Knowledge is absolute power. However, without the possibility to execute, knowledge becomes worthless. I realized this axiom when I started learning magic. It doesnâ€™t matter how many magic tricks you learned, it all matters on how you can present yourself. Presentation is 99% of your ability to perform magic. 
	  I spent my last year of high school performing magic professionally. It allowed me to truly showcase my art and get payed for it. I plan to one day pickup my art and showcase it as a professional.
