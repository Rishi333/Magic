I have a deep gratitude for finding Proofpoint. They definitely have a culture that sparks, “the let’s get it done” Attitude. They provide a relaxing environment that provides the developer time to create something beautiful. I spent my internship having a wonderful time creating my art. I was suddenly enlightened by the raw knowledge that Proofpoint had to offer me. Proofpoint open sourced many of their libraries as well as use beautiful ruby. I realized that the knowledge, I use here, I can use anywhere due to the usage of opensource code. Finally, I got to give a shout out to Cassandra. Cassandra is truly one of a kind, and changed my understanding of beauty.
