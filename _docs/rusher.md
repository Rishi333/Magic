Mobile app development is the closest thing to the modern American Dream in my opinion. It is a possibility to achieve financial freedom by making an app that will impact millions of users. Even though I had absolutely no experience, I wanted to create an iOS app. At the time, apple used objective-c to build their apps. It took me two whole weeks to learn the language and do several homework assignments from Stanfordâ€™s iTunes page. Once I felt well versed in Objective-C, I went on my app adventure.

I quickly realized that I absolutely knew nothing about what I was doing. However, my will power with the addition of Google, helped me realize my first application. I realized that my father consistently asked me to map the directions when we travelled by car. To make my life easier, I wanted to create a app that would help me search the web for addresses and then use google maps to help me route. I spent a week developing and a week testing. It finally resulted in a app that met my standards. I finally published my app to the app store. I got over 2000 downloads, but by the end of the year, I did not want to renew my developer contract. Thus, I ended my app developer career. One day, I will continue this dream and create mobile apps for making millions of lives easier.
