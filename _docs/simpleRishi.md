The Turing test is a intelligence test for a computer. It requires a human to interact with a computer and determine if it has human characteristics. I created a twitter bot that attempts to pass the Turing test. The bot assumes that all verbal sentences have one answer. It parses your sentences, and responds with what it has been taught.
