## Basic Info:

I have been a long time fan of Mario. At a point, I even attempted to beat some levels blindfolded. Thus, it only made sense to convert my fanboyishness into my first "finished" game. I built a game from complete scratch. This includes the phsycis engine, art, design and graphics. I wanted to prove that games could be created in a scalable model. The engine is built in a multi-threaded fashion. You are free to play and download the source code of my game here:
